# SL13. Conway's Game of Life

# We now discovered that the amount of money in the bag only pays for a coffee, half muffin and a couple of Smints. So we realized that we still
# have to be developers in order to pay rent. Isn’t that great? :)

# This got ourselves thinking about Life, in capitals. How we are just particles in the Universe, and how the shitty end of Lost is not THAT
# important (though, JJ Abrams, SERIOUSLY?).

# Anyway, while we are philosophing about Everything, we end up discovering about Conway’s Game of Life. More information is in here:
# http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life

# We think this is a pretty cool game, so we want in, and decide to implement it. But not implement it cowboy-style: we know TDD! So we get
# prepared, roll up our sleeves (wait, no, it’s summer!) and implement this funny game, step by step, with TDD.

# Have fun!

# PD: when you finish, you can check how to do it in here:
